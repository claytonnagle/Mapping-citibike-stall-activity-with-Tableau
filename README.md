# Tableau Challenge--Mapping Citibike station data with Tableau
## Goals
This project was meant to be a cursory introduction to the use of Tableau as a tool for mapping data. Tableau serves as a singular tool to combine the same kind of ETL, graphing, and analysis techniques learned thoughout the bootcamp this assignment was done for. 

The goal of this individual project was to load data provided by the instructor, and we would perform various visual manipulations based on what was asked. We were given prompts on what kind of visualisations to create, but it was up to the students to figure out how to reach the end goal. 

Although this was a more simplistic project, this is the only individual project we were assigned involving Tableau work, and so I wanted to include it as an example of my understanding of the software.
